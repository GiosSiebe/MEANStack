# MEAN Stack with Apache, PostgreSQL, and Node.js
## Overview
This project is a MEAN stack application that utilizes Apache as a reverse proxy, PostgreSQL as the database, and Node.js for the backend. The frontend makes an API call to fetch container ID and name from the database and displays them on the frontend. The application is designed to run in a Kubernetes cluster using Kind (Kubernetes in Docker).
